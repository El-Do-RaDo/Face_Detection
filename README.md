# Face_Detection

Face detection in OpenCV using haarCascade FrontalFace file.

A Haar Cascade is basically a classifier which is used to detect the object for which it has been trained for, from the source. The Haar Cascade is trained by superimposing the positive image over a set of negative images. The training is generally done on a server and on various stages.

Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images, Face detection can consider a substantial part of face recognition operations.  It is a part of object detection and can use in many areas such as security, bio-metrics, law enforcement, entertainment, personal safety, etc.

There are many techniques to detect faces, with the help of these techniques, we can identify faces with higher accuracy. These techniques have an almost same procedure for Face Detection such as OpenCV, Neural Networks, Matlab, etc.
